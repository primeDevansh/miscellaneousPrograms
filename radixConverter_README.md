### Why track both, first and last elements of a Queue?

It's typically necessary to keep track of both the first and last elements in a queue. While you can implement a queue with just a pointer to the first element, having a pointer to the last element provides several advantages:

**Efficient Enqueue Operation:** With a pointer to the last element (lastQueue), you can enqueue elements in constant time (O(1)). Without it, you would need to traverse the entire queue to find the last element, resulting in a linear time complexity (O(n)) for each enqueue operation.

**Simplifies Dequeue Operation:** Having both first and last pointers makes dequeuing (removing elements from the front of the queue) simpler and more efficient, especially in a singly linked list implementation. With just a pointer to the first element, removing the first element would require traversing the queue to find the new first element, resulting in linear time complexity (O(n)). With a pointer to the last element, the dequeue operation can be done in constant time (O(1)).

**Implementation Flexibility:** Keeping track of both the first and last elements allows for more flexibility in implementing various queue operations, especially in scenarios where you need to efficiently access both ends of the queue.

While it's technically possible to implement a queue with just a pointer to the first element, maintaining a pointer to the last element significantly improves the efficiency and simplicity of enqueue and dequeue operations, making the queue more practical for real-world use cases.
